A randomizer tool to help learn kanji characters

The idea is to make a tool that gives the user a user-defined number of random kanji characters to practice writing either from memory or with an example provided. Kanji are separated between JLPT (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) levels which can be selected individually.

Grammar topics might be added as randomizer options in the future but for now the focus is on kanji because those are the biggest pain in the neck for my Japanese learning right now.
